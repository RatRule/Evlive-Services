            <p>At Unsplash Inc. (“Company” or “we”), we recognize the need to protect the privacy of the personal information
                we collect or you provide to us when you access and use our website (unsplash.com) (the “Website”).</p>
            <p>Therefore, we have adopted this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”), which sets forth, among other things,
                the type of information that will be collected, the purpose and use of the collected information, and your
                rights with regard to the collected information. By accessing the Website, you are consenting to the collection
                and the use of your information by Company, but only to the extent described herein. Should you wish to revoke
                your consent, you may do so in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 below.</p>
            <p>The Company may make modifications, deletions and/or additions to this Privacy Policy (“Changes”) at any time.
                Changes will be effective: (i) thirty (30) days after the Company provides notice of the Changes, whether
                such notice is provided through the Website user interface, is sent to the email address associated with
                your account (if applicable) or otherwise; or (ii) when you opt-in or otherwise expressly agree to the Changes
                or a version of this Privacy Policy incorporating the Changes, whichever comes first. Please note that the
                last update was performed on October 28, 2014. If the modified terms are not acceptable, please do not access
                or use the Website.</p>
            <h4>1. Protection of Your Information</h4>
            <p>We are accountable for the information in our custody. Therefore, when we collect or use your information, we
                will utilize commercially reasonable safeguards to ensure its protection. It should be noted that no security
                procedure is currently 100% effective. Should any breach of your Personal Information occur, we will inform
                you as soon as reasonably possible, as required by applicable law.</p>
            <h4>2. Type and Purpose of Collection</h4>

                two types of information are collected:</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>
                    <p>Non-Personal Information: Upon accessing the Website, certain non-personal information will be automatically
                        collected without your knowledge or consent, such as your IP address and the referring website (“Non-Personal
                        Information”). We use Non-Personal Information to examine our traffic and to view how our customers
                        use the Website. This type of information will not allow you to be personally identified. For example,
                        we use “cookies”, which contains only certain statistical information. You can instruct your computer
                        to inform you whenever a cookie is being sent, or you can disallow cookies through your web browser.

                        to choose some of the options on the Website may be limited.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Identifying Personal Information: To utilize some portions of the Website or some of the services provided
                        therein, you may be required to first provide personal information that will allow you to be identified
                        (“Personal Information”). This type of information will not be collected without your consent. The
                        purposes of the collection of Personal Information are the following:</p>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>To establish a relationship with you;</li>
                        <li>To facilitate your service with our affiliated service providers;</li>
                        <li>To allow you to post a picture on the Website, and to identify you as having posted a picture on

                        <li>To anticipate and resolve problems with your service;</li>
                        <li>To understand your needs and desires vis-à-vis the Website;</li>
                        <li>To update you on changes to our services or products, including new promotions.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>We expressly acknowledge that we will not use your Personal Information for any other purposes without your consent.
                Further, we will only collect Personal Information to the extent necessary for the abovementioned purposes.
                The Personal Information we collect will vary depending on how you are using the Website, but may include,
                without limitation, your address, phone number, email address and credit card information.</p>
            <h4>3. Right to Examine Information</h4>
            <p>You have the right to examine any of your Personal Information that we collect. Should you wish to examine such
                information, please send us a written request to support@unsplash.com. We reserve the right to charge you
                a reasonable administrative fee to access your information, as permitted by applicable law. In certain cases
                we may not be able to provide you with access to all of your Personal Information (ex: if the information
                also pertains to the Personal Information of another user).</p>
            <h4>4. Withdrawal of Consent</h4>
            <p>You may withdraw your consent to the collection of Personal Information at any time by sending a written request
                to support@unsplash.com. Upon receiving notice that you have revoked your consent, we will stop using your
                Personal Information within a reasonable time, which will vary depending on what information we have collected
                and for what purpose. Please note that we will send you an email confirmation upon receipt of your request.
                Therefore, if you do not receive a confirmation email, please contact us again with your request. If you
                do choose to withdraw such consent, your experience on the Website may be diminished, or your ability to
                choose some of the options on the Website or the services provided therein may be limited.</p>
            <h4>5. Sharing Information</h4>
            <p>We will not sell, rent or disclose to outside parties the information we collect, save and except that we may
                share the collected information with other parties as follows:
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>Affiliated Service Providers: We have agreements with various affiliated service providers to facilitate
                        the functioning of the Website, with whom we may share the information we have collected. For example,
                        we may share your credit card information with the credit card service provider to process your purchase.
                        All administrative service providers that we use are required to have the same level of privacy protection
                        as we have, and therefore we expect that your information will be handled with the same level of
                        care that we employ.</li>
                    <li>Where required by law: We may share the collected information where required by law, specifically in

            <h4>7. International Transfer</h4>
            <p>Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your jurisdiction, where
                privacy laws may not be as protective as your jurisdiction. Your consent to this Privacy Policy represents
